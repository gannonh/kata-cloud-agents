## The self-driving codebase

Background agents work across the entire SDLC.

Software delivery was designed around constraints of humans at keyboards. Now, agents run autonomously across thousands of repos in the background. This trend is already in motion at companies like Stripe, who recently published about their Minions platform, and Ramp. Our old processes can't absorb these changes anymore. Now, every engineering leader is asking the same question: how do we get from today's delivery process to a self-driving codebase?

## Our systems are bottlenecked by localhost

Autocomplete became coding agents. Coding agents became three coding agents running in parallel on your laptop. Engineers reached for worktrees, more and more terminals, spare Mac Minis. Anything to run more agents.

But localhost wasn't built for this. Agents fight over machine state, secrets become exposed, and everything stops when the machine sleeps.

That works for indie-hackers, but is untenable for professional engineering. We must de-couple engineers from workstations. Agents need to run in the background, securely, and at scale.

## The false summit

**Individual speed ≠ organizational velocity.**

You rolled out coding agents. Engineers are faster. PRs flood in.

Yet, cycle time doesn't budge. DORA metrics are flat. The backlog grows.

Because gains are compounding with the individual, not the organization. The longer you invest in coding agents without addressing the system around it, the deeper you entrench.

This is the false summit.

### The path forward

1. **Step 01** — Establish background agent primitives
2. **Step 02** — Find your systems bottlenecks
3. **Step 03** — Scale your software factory

## What is a background agent

**The answer: agents that run in the background**

A coding agent needs your machine and your attention. A background agent needs neither. It runs in its own development environment in the cloud: full toolchain, test suite, everything. Completely decoupled from your device and your session.

Kick one off from your laptop, check the result from your phone. Trigger it from a PR, a Slack thread, a Linear ticket, a webhook, or just spin one up manually.

You're not steering it. You're not watching it. It's an asynchronous task: delegate, walk away, review later. It runs for as long as it needs to.

### Coding agent vs. Background agent

| | Coding agent | Background agent |
|---|---|---|
| **Where they run** | Your laptop or local machine | Cloud infrastructure, triggered remotely |
| **How they're triggered** | You invoke them manually | Events, schedules, Slack messages, API calls — any signal |
| **Scope** | Single task in one repo | Across repos, teams, and the full SDLC |
| **Developer's role** | In the loop — watching, steering, iterating | On the loop — prompt, walk away, review the output |

## Step 01: Establish background agent primitives

Autonomous agents need infrastructure that doesn't exist on your laptop. The building blocks below are what separate a demo from a deployment — sandboxed execution, governance, connectivity to your internal systems, trigger automation, and fleet coordination. Each one unlocks the next.

### Development Environment

**The agent needs a computer**

Agents running in the background need their own execution environment with a full toolchain, ability to run tests and access via secrets to systems.

Environments should be isolated, and reproducible with close parity to production systems to allow fleets of agents. Everything else builds on top of this.

#### Pattern 1: Agent has dev environment

The agent has a full development environment. A VM running a dev container with your codebase, test suite, databases, and internal network access.

This is the closest to how a human developer works. Every enterprise that has shared their agent architecture publicly including Stripe and Ramp chose this pattern.

Components: VM → Dev Container → Agent → Codebase, Test suite, Build system, Databases, Internal APIs, Secrets, Private registries

#### Pattern 2: Sandbox as tool (E2B)

The agent runs on a server or locally. When it needs to execute code, it calls a separate remote sandbox via API. The sandbox runs the code and returns the result. This keeps secrets and execution somewhat isolated, but the agent can only execute code and not fully develop.

Best suited for companies building agent products than organizations improving their own engineering workflows.

Components: Your Server → Agent (Secrets, State, Reasoning) → Sandbox (container) via API → Execute code → Return result

### Governance

**Enforced at runtime, not by prompt**

Agents are actors in your system. They need the same controls as human contributors — identity, permissions, audit trails.

The difference: governance enforced by a system prompt ("please don't delete files") is a suggestion. Governance enforced at the execution layer — deny lists, scoped credentials, deterministic command blocking — is actual governance. Without it, security teams veto autonomous agents entirely. And they're right to.

### Context & Connectivity

**Behind your firewall**

A sandbox that can't reach your internal systems is a toy. Agents need to assume IAM roles, query database replicas, hit internal APIs, and pull from private registries — all from inside your network. Context and connectivity turn isolated execution into real work.

### Triggers

**Remove the human from the invocation loop**

If every agent run starts with a developer typing a prompt, you haven't automated the workflow — just the work. Triggers connect agents to the events that matter: schedules, webhooks, system signals. Each pattern maps to a different scope and cadence.

- **⏱ Scheduled agents** — Triggered on a timer. Predictable, bounded, high-volume — dependency updates, lint sweeps, coverage enforcement.
- **⚡ Event-driven agents** — Triggered by system events — a PR opened, a CVE published, an alert fired. Reactive, concurrent, always listening.
- **⊞ Agent fleets** — One task across many repositories. Each agent works independently and produces its own contribution.
- **◉ Agent swarms** — Many agents, one outcome. Every agent works on a different facet and results converge into a single deliverable.
- **📱 Mobile** — Trigger one, or many agents direct from your phone, or iMessage. One text, and a fleet fans out. The new TDD, Taxi Driven Development.

### Fleet Coordination

**One intent, every repo**

Updating one repository is a coding agent task. Updating 500 is a fleet task. The same sandbox, replicated across every repository that needs the change — parallel provisioning, progress tracking, aggregated results. This is where individual productivity becomes organizational throughput.

## Step 02: Find your systems bottlenecks

The primitives give you the capability. Where you apply them is what matters. That means doing the work: surveying your developers, sitting with your teams, mapping where time goes. Every organization's bottlenecks are different. The ones worth solving first aren't always obvious.

### Code reviews that pile up faster than ever

PRs sit for hours while you context-switch. At scale, review queues back up and lead time stays flat despite faster coding. A background agent reviews every PR before a human sees it, so reviewers focus on design, not formatting.

---

## Step 03: Scale your software factory

The engineering organization is an industrial system. Today, developers stand at every station: writing, reviewing, testing. Background agents change the operating model. The factory runs, but your engineers move on the loop instead of in it.

PLAN | CODE | REVIEW | TEST | DEPLOY

- Every PR is reviewed by an agent before a human sees it
- CI failures are investigated and fixed before a developer is paged
- Developers never manually resolve merge conflicts on agent PRs
- Agents do the first-pass investigation into every production incident
- Security vulnerabilities are patched within hours, not sprints

## Towards a self-driving codebase

**Your engineers aren't in the loop. They're on the loop.**

The factory floor is running. Code is being written, reviewed, tested, deployed — continuously, autonomously. Your engineers are observing. Setting constraints. Verifying outcomes.
